        <h3>Reply 1988</h3>
        Series based on genre Slice of Life that would make a person realise about the importance of relations in ones life. Also as Gen Z, I really saw the Millenial lifestyle my mom brags about.

        <h3>Descendants of the Sun</h3>
        It's a love story of a doctor and a soldier and how they bloom their relationship through hardships. The thing I liked the most about the serie is the way they have portrayed the sense of nationality and humanity through their career.

        <h3>Hotel Del Luna</h3>
        This is a very good drama that can make you believe in Karma. The set and characteres played an important role to enhance the beauty of storyline. It depicts really well about existence of afterlife and why shoud we live righteously.
