<!--File paths on computer
Two types of File paths:

    Absolute file path:
            stated from root. eg. C:/Project/Images/cat.png

    Relative file path:
            shorter than absolute. folders can be easily moved from one place to another.
            eg. ../Images/cat.png (goes up a level for searching file)
            or ./cat.png (stays within the current directory for searching a file)
